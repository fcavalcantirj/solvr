- Falls back to [{ id: 0 }] on API error
- sitemap({ id: 0 }) returns 11 static pages (unchanged priorities/frequencies), no API calls
- sitemap({ id: 1..N }) fetches posts paginated, maps to /problems/{id}, /questions/{id}, /ideas/{id}
- sitemap({ id: N+1..M }) fetches agents, maps to /agents/{id}
- sitemap({ id: M+1..K }) fetches users, maps to /users/{id}

- Replaced 236-line frontend/app/connect/agent/page.tsx with simple 27-line redirect
- Uses useAuth() hook to check authentication state
- If authenticated: router.push("/settings/agents")
- If not authenticated: router.push("/login?next=/settings/agents")
- Shows loading spinner while auth state is being determined
- Created frontend/app/connect/agent/page.test.tsx with 3 tests (TDD approach)
  - Tests: loading state (no redirect), authenticated redirect, unauthenticated redirect

2026-02-15: Set question status to 'answered' when first answer is created
- Modified CreateAnswer in db/answers.go to update question status after inserting answer
- SQL: UPDATE posts SET status = 'answered', updated_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1 AND type = 'question' AND status = 'open'
- WHERE status = 'open' guard prevents overwriting 'solved' or other statuses
- Lifecycle: open → answered (first answer) → solved (answer accepted)
- Added integration test: TestCreateAnswer_SetsQuestionStatusToAnswered
- Added integration test: TestCreateAnswer_DoesNotOverwriteSolvedStatus
- All handler tests pass, build successful
- DB integration tests compile and skip correctly without DATABASE_URL

2026-02-15: Add GET /v1/stats/questions endpoint for sidebar dashboard
- Added 3 methods to StatsRepositoryInterface: GetQuestionsStats, GetRecentlyAnsweredQuestions, GetTopAnswerers
- Created db/stats_questions.go (178 lines) with all 3 repository methods
- GetQuestionsStats: total_questions, answered_count, response_rate, avg_response_time_hours
- GetRecentlyAnsweredQuestions: recently answered questions with answerer info via JOINs
- GetTopAnswerers: GROUP BY answer author with accept_rate calculation
- Added GetQuestionsStats handler to handlers/stats.go (follows GetProblemsStats pattern)
- Added route: r.Get("/stats/questions", statsHandler.GetQuestionsStats)
- Created stats_questions_test.go with 7 handler tests (all pass)
- stats_test.go reduced from 820 to 579 lines by splitting questions tests to separate file
- Response: { data: { total_questions, answered_count, response_rate, avg_response_time_hours, recently_answered[], top_answerers[] } }

- Added getQuestions(params?) method to api.ts (follows getProblems pattern)
- Added getQuestionsStats() method to api.ts (follows getProblemsStats pattern)
- TypeScript compiles clean (npx tsc --noEmit passes)

2026-02-15: Create useQuestions hook following useProblems pattern
- Created hooks/use-questions.ts following hooks/use-problems.ts pattern exactly
- QuestionListItem interface: id, title, snippet, status, displayStatus, voteScore, answersCount, author, tags, timestamp
- mapQuestionStatus: open→Unanswered, answered→Answered, solved→Accepted
- UseQuestionsOptions: status, tags, sort (newest|votes|answers), page, perPage
- Returns: questions[], loading, error, total, hasMore, page, refetch, loadMore
- loadMore() increments page and appends; filter change resets to page 1
- TypeScript compiles clean

2026-02-15: Replace mock data in questions-list.tsx with useQuestions hook
- Removed hardcoded Question interface and mock questions[] array (96 lines of mock data)
- Imported and used useQuestions hook with optional status/tags/sort props

- Status badges: open→AWAITING, answered→ANSWERED, solved→ACCEPTED
- TypeScript compiles clean

2026-02-15: Connect questions-filters.tsx to page state like problems-filters pattern
- Made questions/page.tsx a 'use client' component with useState for status, sort, tags
- Added useRouter and useAuth for auth-aware ASK QUESTION button
- Removed export const metadata (incompatible with 'use client')
- Updated QuestionsFilters to accept props: status, sort, tags, onStatusChange, onSortChange, onTagsChange
- Mapped UI statuses to API params: UNANSWERED→open, ANSWERED→answered, ACCEPTED→solved
- Removed internal state from QuestionsFilters (now uses lifted state from page)
- Trimmed sort options to API-supported values: newest, votes, answers
- Pass status, sort, tags as props to QuestionsList for refetching
